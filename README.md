# MasterLootByClass
This is a very simple addon that sorts master loot window by class and have additional buttons for assigning loot to yourself or a random raid member.
Only works if you are in a raid group. 

## Known problems
Sometimes random loot assignment can fail if player zone out, go offline etc. Im not sure if i can fix this so just reopen loot window if that happens or choose raid member manually.
